# Object Detection Model

This model is a deep learning-based object detection model that can identify and locate specific items in an image. The model is trained on a dataset of images and corresponding object bounding boxes, and can be used to detect and locate objects in new images.

The model is implemented using YOLO and a sample of coco2017 image, and the code is available in this repository. The model can be fine-tuned on a new dataset to detect different objects or improve detection accuracy.
